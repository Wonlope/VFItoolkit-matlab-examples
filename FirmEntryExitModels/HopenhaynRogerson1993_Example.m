%% Value Function Problem (with endogenous exit)
% Entry is irrelevant to the value function problem. Exit is relevant, and treated differently based on whether it is endogenous or exogenous.

% For exogenous exit, you would simply need to include the 'conditional surivival probability' as another 'DiscountFactorParamNames'
DiscountFactorParamNames={'beta'};
% For endogenous exit, you need to set
vfoptions.endogenousexit=1;
% We also need to create 'vfoptions.ReturnToExitFn' (and 'vfoptions.ReturnToExitFnParamNames'), as below.

ReturnFn=@(aprime,a,z,p,alpha,tau,cf) HopenhaynRogerson1993_ReturnFn(aprime, a, z, p, alpha, tau, cf);

% For endogenous exit, also need to define the 'return to exit'.
vfoptions.ReturnToExitFn=@(a,z,tau) -tau*a*(a~=10^6); % the exit cost is the cost of firing all remaining employees (pg 919 of Hopenhayn & Rogerson, 1993).
% The inputs to vfoptions.ReturnToExitFn are (a,z) followed by any parameters
% Remark: if a more complex 'return to exit' was desired it could be
% created in much the same way as the ReturnFn is created, but depends only
% on (a,z) variables and any parameters named as additional inputs.
% The following commented out line provides an 'example' of how to do this
% ReturnToExitFn=@(a, s) HopenhaynRogerson1993_ReturnToExitFn(a, s);

% Check that everything is working so far by solving the value function
[V,Policy,ExitPolicy]=ValueFnIter_Case1(n_d,n_a,n_z,d_grid,a_grid,z_grid, pi_z, ReturnFn, Params, DiscountFactorParamNames, [], vfoptions);

% When tau=0 there is a cut-off value of z below which all firms exit, and which is independent of n.
% This can be easily seen graphing the whole of the ExitPolicy, which takes
% a value of 1 for exit, and 0 when not choosing to exit.

% for algorithm turns out to be useful info

% Distribution of new agents:

% Need to put the new entrants into the 'special value' used to indicate new entrants so they can receive special treatment as per footnote.
Params.upsilon=[zeros(n_a-1,1);1]*[ones(1,floor(0.65*n_z)),zeros(1,n_z-floor(0.65*n_z))]; % 'special value' is last point in a_grid

% "We found that a uniform distribution on the lower part of the interval in which realizations of s 
% lie produced a reasonable fit.", pg 930 of Hopenhayn & Rogerson (1993), but no mention of what constitutes 'lower part'.
% Martin Flodén concludes that roughly the bottom 2/3 (0.65 to be precise) is a good definiting of 'lower' (pg 5): http://martinfloden.net/files/macrolab.pdf

% Note: VFI Toolkit requires the DistOfNewAgents to be a pdf (so unit mass), and then uses
% the 'MassOfNewAgents' to understand how many there will be entering
% relative to existing agents. (MassOfExistingAgents is kept track of.)

EntryExitParamNames.MassOfNewAgents={'Ne'};
% Note: this is just an initial guess, as it will anyway need to be determined in general equilibrium.

% Exit can be given in one of two forms. As a function, or as a matrix.

% simoptions.CondlProbOfSurvival=1-ExitPolicy;
EntryExitParamNames.CondlProbOfSurvival={'zeta'};

%% General Equilibrium with endogenous entry and endogenous exit.

% Notice that exit (whether endogenous or exogenous) does not involve any
