% Example based on Imrohoroglu, Imrohoroglu & Joines (1995) - A life cycle analysis of social security
% But adding Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.

%% Use Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting. I have put all the lines that relate to Quasi-hyperbolic discounting together to simplify reading.
% There are essentially three parts to using Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.
% 1. Use vfoptions to state that you are using Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.
% 2. (optional) Use vfoptions to state whether you want 'naive' or 'sophisticated' Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting. (Optional as naive by default)
% 3. Set the appropriate preference parameters.
% 4. Minor adjustment to 'discount factors'.

% 1. Use vfoptions to state that you are using Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.
% The quasi-hyperbolic preferences are controlled using,
vfoptions.exoticpreferences='QuasiHyperbolic' % Use the quasi-hyperbolic preferences
% To turn off, either don't delare vfoptions.exoticpreferences, or set vfoptions.exoticpreferences='None'
% If you turn this off you would just solve the same model but with standard exponential discounting (parameter beta0 removed from discount factor by code below). 
% This is intended as purely illustrative. A serious comparison of the preference types would require you to recalibrate the model.

% 2. (optional) Use vfoptions to state whether you want 'naive' or 'sophisticated' Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting. (Optional as naive by default)
% Also need to choose which of the two quasi-hyperbolic solutions, naive or sophisticated, to use.
% vfoptions.quasi_hyperbolic='Naive' % This is the default, alternative is 'Sophisticated'.
vfoptions.quasi_hyperbolic='Sophisticated' % This is the default, alternative is 'Sophisticated'.

% 3. Set the appropriate preference parameters.
Params.beta0=0.85; % The quasi-hyperbolic discounting parameter controlling 'additional' discounting between 'today and tomorrow'
Params.beta=1.011; % The quasi-hyperbolic discounting parameter controlling discounting between any two periods (note that once combined with the survival probabilites this give a discount factor that is typically less than one).
% Quasi-hyperbolic discounting is sometimes refered to as 'alpha-beta'
% discounting. In this case alpha would refer to beta0*beta which is the discount factor between the current period and next period (and beta is beta :).
% Note that setting beta0=1 would give standard exponential discounting.

% 4. Minor adjustment to 'discount factors'.
% For quasi-hyperbolic preferences the last element of DiscountFactorParamNames must be the 'today-to-tomorrow' additional discount factor.
DiscountFactorParamNames={'beta','sj','gdiscount','beta0'};
% Note that when using Quasi-hyperbolic discounting beta just acts like a
% standard discounting parameter, only beta0 needs to be treated specially.

% If not using quasi-hyperbolic discounting then disable beta0 by setting
if strcmp(vfoptions.exoticpreferences,'None')
    DiscountFactorParamNames={'beta','sj','gdiscount'};
end

% That is all. Every other line of code is unchanged!! Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting really is that easy ;)
